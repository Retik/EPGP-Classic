# EPGP Classic

EPGP-Classic can work on `WOW Classic`.

## Relationship with [epgp (dkp reloaded)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-dkp-reloaded)

This project is a fork of the [EPGP Next](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-next) addon, which was a fork of [epgp (dkp reloaded)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-dkp-reloaded) and NOT working on WOW Classic. Special thanks to all the previous authors who got us this far. Uninstall (delete) or disable ANY other EPGP addons before using this one.

`EPGP` is an Effort/Gear reward system and addon for World of Warcraft. The addon can work completely in game, storing the data in your guild's officer notes.

Current progress on this fork supports all prior functionality. If you want any other functions, please tell me.
